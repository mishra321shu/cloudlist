# Providers

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Amazon Web Services can be integrated by using the following configuration block.

```yaml
- # provider is the name of the provider
  provider: aws
  # profile is the name of the provider profile
  profile: staging
  # aws_access_key is the access key for AWS account
  aws_access_key: AKIAXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  # aws_secret_key is the secret key for AWS account
  aws_secret_key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  # aws_session_token session token for temporary security credentials retrieved via STS (optional)
  aws_session_token: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

`aws_access_key` and `aws_secret_key` can be generated in the IAM console. We recommend creating a new IAM user with `Read Only` permissions and providing the access token for the user.

Scopes Required - 
1. EC2
2. Route53

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Google Cloud Platform can be integrated by using the following configuration block.

```yaml
- # provider is the name of the provider
  provider: gcp
  # profile is the name of the provider profile
  profile: staging
  # gcp_service_account_key is the key token of service account.
  gcp_service_account_key: '{}'
```

`gcp_service_account_key` can be retrieved by creating a new service account. To do so, create service account with Read Only access to `cloudresourcemanager` and `dns` scopes in IAM. Next, generate a new account key for the Service Account by following steps in Reference 2. This should give you a json which can be pasted in a single line in the `gcp_service_account_key`.

```yaml
- # provider is the name of the provider
  provider: do
  # digitalocean_token is the API key for digitalocean cloud platform

```

`digitalocean_token` can be generated from the Digitalocean Control Panel. We recommend only giving Read Access to the token.

  # scaleway_access_token is the access token for scaleway API
  scaleway_access_token: xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxx
```

`scaleway_access_key` and `scaleway_access_token` can be generated from the Credentials Options in scaleway console.
